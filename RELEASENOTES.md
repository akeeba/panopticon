This version is a maintenance release. 

The focus of this release has been adding WordPress sites to Panopticon. This is now working far more reliably, allowing us to now consider support for WordPress a stable feature.

## 🖥️ System Requirements

* PHP 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, or 8.4. PHP 8.3 recommended.
* MySQL 5.7 or later, or MariaDB 10.3 or later. MySQL 8.0 recommended.
* Ability to run CRON jobs, either command-line (recommended) or URLs with a frequency of once every minute, and an execution time of at least 30 seconds (up to 180 seconds are strongly preferred).

## 🔮 What's coming next?
