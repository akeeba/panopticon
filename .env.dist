## Akeeba Panopticon – .env configuration file
##
## WARNING! Using .env files to configure Akeeba Panopticon has the following
## side-effects:
##
## - The config.php file is ignored
## - The System Configuration page is no longer available
## - You will not go through the Setup page
##
## You should only use .env files with Akeeba Panoption if you are doing an
## unattended, command-line installation. Everyone else is strongly recommended
## to follow the regular installation and configuration procedure.
##
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
##
## To use this file, copy it to .env and edit it.
##
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
##
## You can use environment-specific .env files. Set the
## PANOPTICON_ENVIRONMENT environemnt variable to a string (if undefined, it is
## assumed to be "production") and Panopticon will **also** try to load the file
## .env.$(PANOPTICON_ENVIRONMENT) e.g. .env.production
##
## You can store your .env files either in the Panopticon installation root, or
## the user_code folder of your site.
